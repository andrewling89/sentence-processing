# Design Decisions

## Application Framework
I have chosen to use Angular2 and TypeScript to write this application. I have chosen Angular2 due to its simplicity and ease of modularity.

## Testing Framework
Unit tests are conducted using Jasmine and PhantomJS. Each Angular2 has a spec.ts file with associated unit tests for all appropriate edge cases.
